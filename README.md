**This plugin is on a very early version. I'll probably have something better on the next week.
**As soon as the code improves I'll be updating the README as well.**  :wink:

Avoid to use this plugin now if you project is not in development. This plugin will be changed a lot in the next days and a stable version has no date to be available.

## I'm working on
- Improve Jitsi configuration; 
- Add a few listeners;
- Create IOS version;
